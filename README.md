# HTML-CSS-learning
My first programming learning at 2022

In 2022 I learned HTML and CSS with courses from Google Activate and Openclassrooms.\
I saved the code but never uploaded it, so now in 2025 I'll add it to my GitHub to make it part of my portfolio.\
With my current knowledge, I will use the version control flow properly using VSCode and my terminal, and fixing any errors I may find.
